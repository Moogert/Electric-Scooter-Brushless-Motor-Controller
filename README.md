# Electric-Scooter-Brushless-Motor-Controller

lowkey mad about having to design a scooter firmware which is why id much rather rip off someone else's design

## status
* hooked up an encoder which seems to be working OK
* need to figure out PWM for the motor, this isn't hard but i still gotta do it
